# Emotion-Aware Question Answering System 

This project presents a hybrid **Question Answering (QA) system** that combines the factual precision of transformer-based models like **BERT** with emotional intelligence, enabling contextually and emotionally responsive answers. Built using HuggingFace Transformers and PyTorch, the system integrates the **SQuAD v1.1** dataset with emotion labels from **IEMOCAP (Text-only)** to create an enhanced user interaction experience.

##  Introduction

In an era where user interaction and emotional intelligence are crucial, this project focuses on building a QA system that not only answers questions accurately but also aligns its responses with the emotional tone of the query. Applications include mental health support, virtual tutors, and emotionally intelligent chatbots.

---

## ⚙ Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python 3.10  
- **Frameworks & Libraries:**  
  - PyTorch  
  - HuggingFace Transformers  
  - Matplotlib, Seaborn (for visualizations)  
- **Platform:** Google Colab (with GPU)  

---

##  Datasets

- **SQuAD v1.1**: For question-answering tasks.  
- **IEMOCAP (Text-only)**: For emotion annotation, includes labels like *happy, sad, angry, excited, neutral, frustrated*.

---

##  Methodology

1. **Dataset Preparation:** Combined QA pairs with emotion labels.
2. **Tokenization:** Used BERT tokenizer for input encoding.
3. **Model Training:** Fine-tuned `bert-base-uncased` using HuggingFace Trainer API.
4. **Emotion-Aware Integration:** Emotion vectors were fused with QA embeddings.
5. **Evaluation:** Used EM, F1 Score, and a custom Emotion-Aware Accuracy metric.

---

##  Evaluation

- **F1 Score:** 85.2%  
- **Exact Match (EM):** 80.4%  
- **Emotion-Aware Accuracy:** 84.1%  

Compared to the baseline model, this approach improved perceived helpfulness by **4.5%**.

---

##  Results

- **Training Time:** ~3 mins per epoch on Colab (Tesla T4 GPU)
- Emotionally aware responses provided a more empathetic interaction.

---

##  Applications

-  Mental Health Assistants  
-  Emotion-aware Virtual Tutors  
-  Empathetic Customer Support Bots  
-  Human-Robot Interaction Interfaces

##  How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/emotion-aware-qa.git
   cd emotion-aware-qa
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the notebook or Python script:
   - Use the provided Jupyter Notebook on **Google Colab** for GPU support.
   - Or execute the main Python script:
     ```bash
     python emotion_aware_qa.py
     ```

---

##  Future Work

- Integrate multimodal data: speech & facial expressions.  
- Extend to dialogue-level memory (multi-turn QA).  
- Incorporate newer models like **DeBERTa**, **RoBERTa**, **ALBERT**.  
- Real-time web deployment with emotional feedback loop.
